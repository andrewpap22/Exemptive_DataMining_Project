# Exemptive Project on Data Mining course of UoA, dept. Of Informatics & Telecommunications. 
### Spring Semester 2020. 

*First and foremost the only file you need to take a look at is the .ipynb file.* 

The .pdf file is the Project Description (written in Greek). 

### What the Project was about... 

The purpose of the project was to create a Machine Learning system that gets as an input,
a comment from a forum and classifies that comment as insulting or neutral. 
We were given the dataset (train, test) in .csv form and we were asked to classify the comments using,
3 classification algorithms: 
1. [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
2. [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)
3. [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)

## Try to reach the Best Score!

**In this particular project the grading was based on trying to reach the best F1-score,
of the ML model that our teachers had. That score was: *0.952*.**


*My personal attempt was reaching the F1-score of: **0.89** which was one of the greatest attempts and
closest to the F1-score that we were given. **So my grading on the project was 100/100**!*


You can see the whole implementation of the project by opening the .ipynb file which contains lot's of explanations,
alongisde the implementation of the project! (in English)
